# 8len
A python code to create '.txt' file which contains strings that have minimum length of 8characters. Might be useful to save some time when minimum length is known, since there are some text file that contains lists of pass in every length.
. an example for using it:

python3 8len.py -i 'A.txt' > A_8.lst

python3 8len.py -i 'A.txt' -o 'A_8.lst'
